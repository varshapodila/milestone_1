            <b>Naina Talwar (Deepika Padukone) is a medical student absorbed in her studies. 
            <u>She tops her classes but feels like an outcast due to her introverted nature.</u> An encounter with an old classmate, Aditi Mehra (Kalki Koechlin), makes her realize that she wants more from life than high marks. 
            Thus, she makes an impulsive decision to follow Aditi on a hiking trip into the Himalayas, up to Manali.
             During the hike, she renews her friendship with other former classmates, Kabir "
        Bunny" Thapar (Ranbir Kapoor) and Avinash "Avi" Arora (Aditya Roy Kapur).
              Bunny is a charmer whose dream is to wander and discover the world and has no interest in ever settling down, while Avi is a playboy and is addicted to beer.</b>

             <i><big>Throughout the trek, Bunny and Naina grow closer.</big>
             One night, the two climb a mountain and Naina sees a new side of Bunny, causing her to grow feelings for him. Meanwhile, Aditi grows jealous of Lara (Evelyn Sharma), one of their acquaintances, as Avi flirts with her a lot.
           Bunny and Naina realize that Aditi has feelings for Avi, but keep quiet.
            At the end of the trip, Naina is close to telling Bunny that she has feelings for him, but is interrupted by Avi who reveals Bunny is accepted into the graduate school of journalism at Northwestern University in Chicago.
             Naina realizes that love and marriage have no part in Bunny's plans and remains silent but is happy for him as he is following his passion.</i>
